This is a basic calculator program in C++ that performs arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) based on the user's input. Here's a breakdown of the code:

Key Components:
Input and Output:

The program prompts the user to enter an operator (+, -, *, or /).
Then, the user is asked to input two numbers (num1 and num2), which will be used in the arithmetic operation.
Switch Statement:

The switch statement checks the operator input (op) to decide which arithmetic operation to perform.
If the operator is +, it adds the two numbers.
If the operator is -, it subtracts the second number from the first.
If the operator is *, it multiplies the two numbers.
If the operator is /, it divides the first number by the second.
If the operator is invalid (not one of the four), it prints an error message indicating that the operator is not valid.

Formatting:

The program displays the result of the operation and then prints a closing line "****************************************".
Possible Improvements:
Input Validation:

There could be further input validation for the numbers (num1 and num2) to ensure that the user enters valid numeric values.
