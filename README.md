This C++ program implements a basic calculator that performs simple arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It prompts the user to input an operator (+, -, *, or /) and two numbers. Based on the operator, the program calculates the result and displays it. If the user enters an invalid operator, an error message is shown. The program uses a switch-case structure to handle the different operations and prints the result to the console.
